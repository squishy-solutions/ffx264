2018-01-06 - ffx264 3.6.2
	* Moved the eq filter to almost the end of the video filter chain
	  as it can lead to banding in certain cases in case the filter

	  is a symlink which may result of encoding files we
	  were not asked to
	* Don't print cropped resolution during runtime
	  if batch mode is selected

	  This removes config file var MAX_AUD_TRACKS and bumps up version
	  to 27

	  subindex since we're not mapping but specifying the audio/sub
	  index id with these vars
